Known Issues on Mac
======================

**1**. Running examples/example_signal.py will result in a Segmentation Fault 11. This is because Mac does not handle cython errors gracefully, therefore using a nonexistant file path will result in segmentation faults.

**2**. Trying to load files that do not exist results in a Segmentation Fault 11.

**3**. Running the following code:
::
	import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
	from pyslgr.MFCCFeatures import MFCCFeatures

	feats = MFCCFeatures()

Gives the following error:
::
	malloc: *** error for object 0x10d1d0b80: pointer being freed was not allocated*** 
	set a breakpoint in malloc_error_break to debug
	Abort trap: 6

To fix this error, simply import any pyslgr module before importing matplotlib.
